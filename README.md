# PlayTogetherApp
This app features a simple UI and graphics.
Users must register an account to access the app. 
After registering, they can sign in using their credentials, which are securely stored in Firebase.
Inside the app, users can explore various game categories and view details such as availability, 
required team numbers, and locations. Users can only join games with available slots,
while games that are fully booked will not offer the option to join.

Now, it also supports crud operations for the admin user, where an admin can add new sport, 
edit and delete the existing sports in the app.
